Hi, I’m Moritz – or just Mo.  
I'm a Senior Software Developer with over 12 years of experience in web and full-stack development, specializing in TypeScript, JavaScript, React, and GraphQL. I focus on writing clean, maintainable code and building straightforward, scalable architectures.

I work on complex applications for well-known clients – often within agile teams and frameworks like Scrum.
If you're looking for an experienced Lead or Senior Frontend/Fullstack Developer based in Freiburg or working remotely, I’d love to hear from you!
